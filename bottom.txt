don't make a right.
is mightier than the sword.
do like the Romans.
gets the grease.
is an island.
favours the bold.
is half done.
should not throw stones.
flock together.
is worth a thousand words.
is the greater part of valor.
catches the worm.
helps those who help themselves.
is next to godliness.
never boils.
can't be choosers.
speak louder than words.
makes perfect.
spoil the broth.

is worth two in the bush
are better than one
is always greener on the other side of the hill
is only as strong as its weakest link
is the best policy
makes the heart grow fonder
is right twice the day
is a dangerous thing
keeps the doctor away
begins with a single step
in love and war
makes Jack a dull boy
has a silver lining
think alike
makes waste
is 20/20
is power
loves company
corrupts
wasn't built in a day
wins the race
run deep
doesn't fall far from the tree
is paved with good intentions
is money
comes around
must come down
is good for the gander
is gold
is a job done well
has a thorn
is not all peaches and cream
cannot buy happiness
make lemonade
begins at home
makes light work
is out of the bag
gathers no moss
first
killed the cat
doesn't grow on trees
