don't make a right.
is mightier than the sword.
do like the Romans.
gets the grease.
is an island.
favours the bold.
is half done.
should not throw stones.
flock together.
is worth a thousand words.
is the greater part of valor.
catches the worm.
helps those who help themselves.
is next to godliness.
never boils.
can't be choosers.
speak louder than words.
makes perfect.
spoil the broth.
is another mans treasure.
is in the eye of the beholder.
is the mother of invention.
is a penny earned.
breeds contempt.
come to those who wait.
