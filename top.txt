Two wrongs
The pen
When in Rome
The squeaky wheel
No man
Fortune
Well begun
People who live in glass houses
Birds of a feather
A picture
Discretion
The early bird
God
Cleanliness
A watched pot
Beggars
Actions
Practice
Too many cooks
One mans trash
Beauty
Necessity
A penny saved
Familiarity
Good things
A bird in the hand
Two heads
The grass
A chain
Honesty
Absence
A broken clock
A little bit of knowledge
An apple a day
A journey of a thousand miles
All is fair
All work and no play
Every cloud
Great minds
Haste
Hindsight
Knowledge
Misery
Power
Rome
Slow and steady
Still waters
The apple
The road to hell
Time
What goes around
What goes up
What's good for the goose
All that glitters
A job done right
Every rose
Life
Money
When life gives you lemons
Charity
Many hands
The cat
A rolling stone
First things
Curiosity
Money
