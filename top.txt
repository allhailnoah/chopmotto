Two wrongs
The pen
When in Rome
The squeaky wheel
No man
Fortune
Well begun
People who live in glass houses
Birds of a feather
A picture
Discretion
The early bird
God
Cleanliness
A watched pot
Beggars
Actions
Practice
Too many cooks
One mans trash
Beauty
Necessity
A penny saved
Familiarity
Good things
